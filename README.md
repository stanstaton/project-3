# Future Work:


# Project Coding:
Each team member had specific areas of work. One person worked on the back-end writing routes and shaping the database models. Another person focused specifically on the front-end and pulling information out of the database. Lastly, another person focused specifically on the aesthetics of the site using a framework by Creative Tim. However, when production slowed down on any piece, all team members moved to work on roadblocks.
